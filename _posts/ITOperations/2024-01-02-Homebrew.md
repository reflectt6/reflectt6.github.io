## [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/zh-cn/)

mac上的包管理工具

### [brew命令](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#commands)

#### `autoremove` [`--dry-run`]

Uninstall formulae that were only installed as a dependency of another formula and are now no longer needed.

- `-n`, `--dry-run`: List what would be uninstalled, but do not actually uninstall anything.

#### `cleanup` [ `options` ] [ `formula` | `cask` ...]

Remove stale lock files and outdated downloads for all formulae and casks, and remove old versions of installed formulae. If arguments are specified, only do this for the given formulae and casks. Removes all downloads more than 120 days old. This can be adjusted with `HOMEBREW_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_DAYS`.

- `--prune`: Remove all cache files older than specified *`days`*. If you want to remove everything, use `--prune=all`.
- `-n`, `--dry-run`: Show what would be removed, but do not actually remove anything.
- `-s`: Scrub the cache, including downloads for even the latest versions. Note that downloads for any installed formulae or casks will still not be deleted. If you want to delete those too: `rm -rf "$(brew --cache)"`
- `--prune-prefix`: Only prune the symlinks and directories from the prefix and remove no other files.

#### `casks`

List all locally installable casks including short names.

#### 更新包：

brew update --auto-update
